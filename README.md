# The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️: To use the IP Geolocation API by IPify, you'll need to sign up for a free account. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific URL (your own domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their own websites. IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. **So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**.
